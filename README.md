The project utilizes Kotlin language and Firebase to develop a mobile application for Android devices, addressing the scarcity of essential school supplies like Arduino parts, resistors, and more. Inspired by the frequent need for these items in school projects, the application enables users to conveniently purchase or rent the required supplies in desired quantities. Students can now access all the materials they need, making their educational journey smoother and more efficient.
